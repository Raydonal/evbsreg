# evbsreg 1.2.0

## New features

* `evbs_monitor()` computes the prospective endpoint-identifiability index
  $F_t$, combining the conformal normal curvature with the finite upper endpoint,
  and `plot.evbs_monitor()` draws the corresponding control chart. Values below
  one indicate that the endpoint is determined by a single observation and should
  not be quoted as a design value.

# evbsreg 1.1.0

## New features

* `logEVBS()` provides a `gamlss.family` implementation of the log-EVBS
  distribution, allowing every parameter, including the tail-shape parameter,
  to depend on covariates or smooth terms. With a constant predictor it
  reproduces the fixed-parameter fit of `evbsreg.fit()`. Companion functions
  `dlogEVBS()`, `plogEVBS()` and `qlogEVBS()` are also provided.
* `devbs()`, `pevbs()` and `qevbs()` complete the distribution family. The
  package previously exported only `revbs()`, so users had no way to compute
  quantiles or return levels.
* `evbs_endpoint()` returns the finite upper endpoint of the fitted model when
  `gama < 0` (Weibull max-domain of attraction).
* `evbs_return_level()` computes return levels and expected shortfall from the
  exact EVBS quantile function.
* `gevreg.fit()`, `gev_scores()` and `cnc_diagnostics_gev()` extend the local
  influence framework to the generalized extreme-value regression model.
* `evbs_block_boot()` provides moving-block bootstrap standard errors for
  series with residual serial dependence.

## Important notes

* The extreme-value index of the EVBS *response* is `2 * gama`, not `gama`. The
  transformation preserves the max-domain of attraction but doubles the tail
  index. Documentation updated accordingly.
* The GEV return-level formula does **not** apply to the EVBS response. Use
  `qevbs()` or `evbs_return_level()`.
* `gevreg.fit()` centres are strongly recommended: the GEV likelihood is poorly
  conditioned for uncentred covariates and may silently fail to converge.
